    Project Objectives
    The Project made shows the correlation of how the amount of possession, coupled with other factors, will likely lead to a goal.
    We utilises the Decision Tree last time we had the project, and for this one, we used both Logistic regression and Random
    Forest. THe best and most optimum model we found was the Logistic Regression, which gave us a 66% accuracy rate.

    Under all these, are visulizations whch help to distinguish all the features between each other and also show the collection
    of data relatively.

    Summary.
    After we used Logistic Regression, we then provided a sample player that had factors satisfying all the features we had
    established in the project, to determine the accuracy and it yielded successful results.

    To run the code, we set it up using Anaconda inside Jupyter Notebook. Every block of code is established already so with
    a push of the run command on each block, everything should go smoothly.
    It is duely noted that the location of the csv file which we are making use of has to be specified because it will exist
    in a different location. So copy the file path of the csv file and paste it appropriately into the code whenever it decides
    to read the file.
